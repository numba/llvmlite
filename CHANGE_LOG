No change to source code.


v0.27.0 (Dec 28, 2018)
----------------------

This release updates llvmlite to LLVM 7.  Note that LLVM 7.0.0 contains
a critical bug that is resolved with a patch included in the `llvmdev conda
package recipe`_.  The final release of LLVM 7.0.1 may also resolve the issue.

* PR #434: Add another thread for RPi builds.
* PR #430: llvm lld integration, merge #428
* PR #428: Build LLD as part of the llvmdev package
* PR #413: Set up CI with Azure Pipelines
* PR #412: LLVM 7 support

v0.26.0 (Nov 27, 2018)
----------------------

The primary new features in this release is support for generation of Intel
JIT events, which makes profiling of JIT compiled code in Intel VTune
possible.  This release also contains some minor build improvements for ARMv7,
and some small fixes.

LLVM 7 support was originally slated for this release, but had to be delayed
after some issues arose in testing.  LLVM 6 is still required for llvmlite.

* PR #409: Use native cmake on armv7l
* PR #407: Throttle thread count for llvm build on armv7l.
* PR #403: Add shutdown detection to ObjectRef __del__ method.
* PR #400: conda recipe: add make as build dep
* PR #399: Add get_element_offset to TargetData
* PR #398: Fix gep method call on Constant objects
* PR #395: Fix typo in irbuilder documentation
* PR #394: Enable IntelJIT events for LLVM for VTune support


v0.25.0 (Sep 18, 2018)
----------------------

This release adds support for the FMA instruction, and has some documentation
and build improvements.  Starting with this release, we are including
ARMv8 (AArch64) testig in our CI process.

* PR #391: Fix broken win32 py2.7 build.
* PR #387: protect against empty features in list
* PR #384: Read CMAKE_GENERATOR which conda-build sets
* PR #382: rewrite of install instructions, calling out LLVM build challenges
* PR #380: Add FMA intrinsic support
* PR #379: ARM aarch64 test on jetson tx2
* PR #378: add slack, drop flowdock


v0.24.0 (Jul 6, 2018)
---------------------

This release adds support for Python 3.7 and fixes some build issues. It also
contains an updated SVML patch for the llvmdev package that works around some
vectorization issues. It also adds a selective LLVM 6.0.1 llvmdev build for the
`ppc64le` architecture.

* PR #374: Fix up broken patch selector
* PR #373: Add long description from readme
* PR #371: LLVM 6.0.1 build based on RC and fixes for PPC64LE
* PR #369: Recipe fixes for Conda Build 3
* PR #363: Workaround for incorrect vectorization factor computed for SVML
  functions
* PR #356: fix build on OpenBSD.
* PR #351: Python 3.7 compat: Properly escape repl in re.sub


v0.23.2 (Jun 1, 2018)
---------------------

This is a bug fix release to assist in addressing a critical Numba issue that
can affect users who download llvmlite packages from sources other than PyPI
(pip), Anaconda, or Intel Python: https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3006

Support for SVML is now detected at compile time and baked into a function that
is exposed by llvmlite. This function can be queried at runtime to find out if
SVML is supported by the LLVM that llvmlite was compiled against, code
generation paths can then be adjusted accordingly.

The following PRs are closed in this release:

* PR #361: Add SVML detection and a function to declare support.


v0.23.1 (May 17, 2018)
----------------------

This is a minor patch release that includes no code changes. It is issued to
fix a couple of problems with the build recipes for llvmdev (on which llvmlite
relies).

The following PRs are closed in this release:

* PR #353: PR Fix llvmdev build recipe.
* PR #348: llvmdev: enhancements to conda recipe


v0.23.0 (Apr 24, 2018)
----------------------

In this release, we upgrade to LLVM 6. Two LLVM patches are added:

  1. A patch to fix LLVM bug (https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37019) that
     causes undefined behavior during CFG printing.
  2. A patch to enable Intel SVML auto-vectorization of transcendentals.

The following PRs are closed in this release:

* PR #343: Fix undefined behavior bug due to Twine usage in LLVM
* PR #340: This moves llvmlite to use LLVM 6.0.0 as its backend.
* PR #339: Add cttz & ctlz
* PR #338: Add 3 Bit Manipulation Intrinsics
* PR #330: Add support for LLVM fence instruction
* PR #326: Enable Intel SVML-enabled auto-vectorization for all the
           transcendentals


v0.22.0 (Feb 15, 2018)
----------------------

In this release, we have changed the locking strategy that protects LLVM from
race conditions.  Before, the llvmlite user (like Numba) was responsible for
this locking.  Now, llvmlite imposes a global thread lock on all calls into
the LLVM API.  This should be significantly less error prone.  Future llvmlite
releases may manually exempt some functions from locking once they are
determined to be thread-safe.

The following PRs are closed in this release:

* PR#318: Ensuring threadsafety in concurrent usage of LLVM C-API
* PR#221: Add all function/return value attributes from LLVM 3.9
* PR#304: Expose support for static constructors/destructors


v0.21.0 (Dec 6, 2017)
---------------------

In this release, we upgrade to LLVM 5.  Our build scripts now use
conda-build 3.  For our prebuilt binaries, GCC 7 toolchain is used
on unix-like systems and the OSX minimum deployment target is 10.9.

The following PRs are closed in this release:

* PR #315: Updates for conda build 3.
* PR #307: Fixes for LLVM5.
* PR #306: Working towards LLVM 5.0 support.


v0.20.0 (Sep 6, 2017)
