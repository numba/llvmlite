v0.9.0 (in development)
-----------------------

Enhancements:

* Switch from LLVM 3.6 to LLVM 3.7.  The generated IR for some memory
  operations has changed.
* Improved performance of IR serialization.
* Issue #116: improve error message when the operands of a binop have
  differing types.
* PR #113: Let Type.get_abi_{size,alignment} not choke on identified types.
* PR #112: Support non-alphanumeric characters in type names.

v0.8.0
------

* Update LLVM to 3.6.2
* Add an *align* parameter to IRBuilder.load() and IRBuilder.store().
* Allow setting visibility, DLL storageclass of ValueRef
* Support profiling with OProfile

v0.7.0
------

* PR #88: Provide hooks into the MCJIT object cache
* PR #87: Add indirect branches and exception handling APIs to ir.Builder.
* PR #86: Add ir.Builder APIs for integer arithmetic with overflow
* Issue #76: Fix non-Windows builds when LLVM was built using CMake
* Deprecate .get_pointer_to_global() and add .get_function_address() and
  .get_global_value_address() in ExecutionEngine.

v0.6.0
------

Enhancements:

* Switch from LLVM 3.5 to LLVM 3.6.  The generated IR for metadata nodes
  has slightly changed, and the "old JIT" engine has been remove (only
  MCJIT is now available).
* Add an optional flags argument to arithmetic instructions on IRBuilder.
* Support attributes on the return type of a function.


v0.5.1
------

Fixes:

* Fix implicit termination of basic block in nested if_then()


v0.5.0
------

New documentation hosted at http://llvmlite.pydata.org

Enhancements:

* Add code-generation helpers from numba.cgutils
* Support for memset, memcpy, memmove intrinsics

Fixes:

* Fix string encoding problem when round-triping parse_assembly()


v0.4.0
------

Enhancements:
* Add Module.get_global()
* Renamd Module.global_variables to Module.global_values
* Support loading library parmanently
* Add Type.get_abi_alignment()

Fixes:
* Expose LLVM version as a tuple

Patched LLVM 3.5.1:
Updated to 3.5.1 with the same ELF relocation patched for v0.2.2.


v0.2.2
-------

Enhancements:
* Support for addrspacescast
* Support for tail call, calling convention attribute
* Support for IdentifiedStructType

Fixes:
* GEP addrspace propagation
* Various installation process fixes

Patched LLVM 3.5:
The binaries from the numba binstar channel use a patched LLVM3.5 for fixing
a LLVM ELF relocation bug that is caused by the use of 32-bit relative offset
in 64-bit binaries.  The problem appears to occur more often on hardened
kernels, like in CentOS.  The patched source code is available at:
https://github.com/numba/llvm-mirror/releases/tag/3.5p1


v0.2.0
-------

This is the first official release. It contains a few feature additions
and bug fixes. It meets all requirements to replace llvmpy in numba and
numbapro.

v0.1.0
-------

This is the first release. This is released for beta testing llvmlite
and numba before the official release.
