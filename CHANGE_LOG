  .get_global_value_address() in ExecutionEngine.

v0.6.0

* Switch from LLVM 3.5 to LLVM 3.6.  The generated IR for metadata nodes
  has slightly changed, and the "old JIT" engine has been remove (only
  MCJIT is now available).

Fixes:

* Fix implicit termination of basic block in nested if_then()


v0.5.0
------

New documentation hosted at http://llvmlite.pydata.org

Enhancements:

* Add code-generation helpers from numba.cgutils
* Support for memset, memcpy, memmove intrinsics

Fixes:

* Fix string encoding problem when round-triping parse_assembly()


v0.4.0
------

Enhancements:
* Add Module.get_global()
* Renamd Module.global_variables to Module.global_values
* Support loading library parmanently
* Add Type.get_abi_alignment()

Fixes:
* Expose LLVM version as a tuple

Patched LLVM 3.5.1:
Updated to 3.5.1 with the same ELF relocation patched for v0.2.2.


v0.2.2
-------

Enhancements:
* Support for addrspacescast
* Support for tail call, calling convention attribute
* Support for IdentifiedStructType

Fixes:
* GEP addrspace propagation
* Various installation process fixes

Patched LLVM 3.5:
The binaries from the numba binstar channel use a patched LLVM3.5 for fixing
a LLVM ELF relocation bug that is caused by the use of 32-bit relative offset
in 64-bit binaries.  The problem appears to occur more often on hardened
kernels, like in CentOS.  The patched source code is available at:
https://github.com/numba/llvm-mirror/releases/tag/3.5p1

-------

This is the first official release. It contains a few feature additions
and bug fixes. It meets all requirements to replace llvmpy in numba and
numbapro.

v0.1.0
