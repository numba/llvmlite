@rem LLVM derives the location of diaguids.lib from the build-time environment.
@rem Conda-forge packaging works around this by substituting the build-time
@rem location of Visual Studio with $ENV{VSINSTALLDIR}. In order to ensure that
@rem this environment variable is set appropriately, we activate the Visual
@rem Studio Developer Command Prompt prior to running setup.py

@rem This workaround is required whilst using LLVM from conda-forge; it may also
@rem be necessary to consider a workaround for our own llvmdev packages.
