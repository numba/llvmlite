Subject: [PATCH] sanitizer_common: Define FP_XSTATE_MAGIC1 for old glibc
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

D116208 (commit 1298273e8206a8fc2) added FP_XSTATE_MAGIC1.
However, when building with glibc < 2.16 for backward-dependency
compatibility, it is not defined - and the build breaks.

Note: The define comes from Linux's asm/sigcontext.h but the
file uses signal.h which includes glibc's bits/sigcontext.h - which
is synced from the kernel's file but lags behind.

Solution: For backward compatility with ancient systems, define
FP_XSTATE_MAGIC1 if undefined.

//For the old systems, we were building with Linux kernel 3.19 but to support really old glibc systems, we build with a sysroot of glibc 2.12. While our kernel (and the users' kernels) have FP_XSTATE_MAGIC1, glibc 2.12 is too old. – With this patch, building the sanitizer libs works again. This showed up for us today as GCC mainline/13 has now synced the sanitizer libs.//
